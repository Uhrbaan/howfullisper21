## Bluetooth
Idea: use multiple Atom lites to detect how many bluetooth devices are active in a given room.
The information from multiple builidings is syncronized to a central database.
A user will be able to load a web page and click on a room to get the near-real-time occupation of said room.

**Requirements:**

- List current near bluetooth devices
- Remember bluetooth devices to not count twice
- Updates every 5 minutes
- Low power
- Sends number of connections over wifi to webserver
- Webserver has to get data from multiple atoms
- Webserver must sense if atoms are alive, notify if dead
- Atoms must automatically reboot if error
- ... ?

### Steps (mostly AI-generated)
1.  **M5Stack Atom Lite Setup:**
    * Install and configure the Arduino IDE for ESP32 development. 
    * Install necessary libraries such as M5Atom and M5Unified. 
2.  **Bluetooth Scanning Implementation:**
    * Develop C code to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using libraries like M5Atom or M5Unified. 
    * Implement logic to extract and store unique device MAC addresses to avoid counting the same device multiple times. 
    * Determine and set an appropriate scanning interval, balancing responsiveness and resource usage. 
3.  **Data Transmission to Server:**
    * Establish a Wi-Fi connection from the Atom Lite to the local network. 
    * Implement HTTP POST requests to send the Bluetooth device count to the Python server. 
    * Format the data in JSON format, including a unique identifier for each Atom Lite. 
    * Handle the server's response and implement error checking. 
4.  **Python Server Setup:**
    * Install Python and the Flask framework. 
    * Create a Flask application and define routes to handle incoming HTTP POST requests. 
    * Implement data storage on the server, initially using an in-memory Python dictionary. 
5.  **Webpage Development:**
    * Create a basic HTML webpage to display the room occupancy information. 
    * Use Flask to serve the webpage and pass the occupancy data to it. 
    * Implement data placeholders in the HTML to dynamically display the occupancy count. 
    * Since manual refresh is acceptable, no complex real-time update techniques are required. 
6.  **Occupancy Estimation Logic:**
    * Define occupancy levels (e.g., Empty, Low, Medium, High) based on predefined ranges or thresholds of detected Bluetooth devices. 
    * Consider calibrating the system by manually counting people and correlating it with Bluetooth device counts to improve accuracy. 
    * Acknowledge the limitations of Bluetooth-based estimation, such as variations in device usage and potential over/underestimation. 
7.  **Testing and Integration:**
    * Test individual components (Atom Lite, server, webpage) to ensure they function correctly.
    * Integrate the components and perform end-to-end testing of the complete system.
    * Deploy the system in the actual environment and conduct final testing and calibration.

Websensor
=========

Introduction
------------

The meta goal of this project is to get accommodated with the C language and different targets it can be compiled to.

Learning goals are:

-   Creating a C project from scratch.
-   Working with C language concepts. (Arrays, Pointers, Data Structures)
-   Incorporating resources from the internet.
-   Autonomously figuring out how to compile C code to different targets (microprocessor).

Your task is to implement a working solution of a websensor based on a low cost microprocessor (ESP8266).

Deliverables to be ready before the final course on Wed, 21. May 2025:

-   Preparation of a final presentation per group (~12min).
-   The runnable code, including testing scripts provided on GitLab with working automated build scripts.
-   A short two pages documentation per group.
-   An individual one page report per participant (Problems encountered, Lessons learned.)

Groups
------

For the project you build up groups with 4 (four) students.

1.  Head on [Moodle](https://moodle.unifr.ch/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=1487139) to join a group.
2.  Head to the [Gitlab group for the projects](https://diuf-gitlab.unifr.ch/sop2025-projects).
3.  Create a new GitLab Project. Use your own, more or less creative `GROUPNAME`.
4.  Finally add all group members to the GitLab Project.

Minimal Features
----------------

![](https://sop.course-unifr.ch/projet/atom_lite_01.png)

-   Aquisision of the sensor value of your chosen sensor.
-   Either send (push) the aquired values to a chosen or implemented web API, or provide a web API on the device itself.
-   Keeping the maximum amount of past values in memory of the microprocessor. Think about a datastructure optimizing for maximum amount of data.

Implementation decisions
------------------------

-   Usage of a library, or implementation of own code for data aquisision.
-   Which data structure to hold the pointers / data. Array, Linked-List, ...
-   Create a server API vs a client API.
-   The architecture of your code, structure of files.

Report the advantages and disadvantages of your implementation decisions regarding API decision and memory usage in the report mentioned in the deliverables.
